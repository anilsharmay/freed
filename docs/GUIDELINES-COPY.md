## What we're here for

This is a place to share what you're going through and get support from others who get it. We keep it **anonymous** and **supportive**.

## What's OK

- Sharing what's on your mind (mental health, relationships, work, life)
- Giving supportive, respectful encouragement and advice
- Being honest and kind

## What's not OK

- **Harassment, hate, or abuse** — no targeting anyone based on identity
- **Solicitation** — no selling, recruiting, or spam
- **Doxxing or identity sharing** — don’t try to identify others or share your own identifying details if you want to stay anonymous
- **Advice that could cause harm** — we’re peer support, not medical or legal advice

## If something’s wrong

Use **Report** on a post or reply. We review reports and may hide content that breaks these guidelines.

## Crisis

If you’re in crisis, please reach out to professionals: **988** (US) or your local crisis line. We’re here for peer support, not emergency care.
